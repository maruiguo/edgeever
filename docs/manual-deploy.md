# Cloudflare Manual Deployment Guide

If you are comfortable with Cloudflare and the command line, or prefer customized control over first installation and resource setup, follow this guide for manual deployment. Cloudflare Workers Builds handles routine updates; local deployment is only for first installation and emergency recovery.

> 💡 **Tip**: If you are deploying using an AI assistant (such as Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, or Cursor), the agent should follow the [AI Agent Cloudflare Deployment](https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever/blob/main/docs/agent-deploy-cloudflare.md) runbook.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Fork the official repository**:
   Visit and fork the official repository: [https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever](https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever)

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```sh
   git clone <your fork repository URL>
   cd edgeever
   ```

3. **Deploy with the automated helper commands**:
   ```sh
   # Copy the configuration template
   cp .env.local.example .env.local

   # Install dependencies
   bun install

   # Initialize deployment resources with the default admin / admin123 login
   bun run deploy:setup

   # Check the deployment environment and configurations
   bun run deploy:doctor

   # Deploy to Cloudflare
   bun run deploy
   ```

   To use a custom first-login password, run `EDGE_EVER_PASSWORD='<your password>' bun run deploy:setup` instead. You can also change the password later in Personal Settings.

   `deploy:setup` always invokes the project-local Wrangler directly, so a global `wrangler` installation is not required and PowerShell, CMD, and Git Bash are supported. If Cloudflare is not authorized yet, the command starts `wrangler login` automatically. If the browser does not open, copy the authorization URL printed in the terminal into a browser and leave the command running until verification completes.

### Creating Cloudflare Resources Manually

If you prefer not to use the automated `deploy:setup` helper, you can create the resources manually using Cloudflare CLI (Wrangler):

```sh
# Copy configuration template and install dependencies
cp .env.local.example .env.local
bun install

# Create the D1 database
bunx wrangler d1 create edgeever

# Create the R2 bucket
bunx wrangler r2 bucket create edgeever-resources

# Edit .env.local and fill in at least the generated resource values
# EDGE_EVER_D1_DATABASE_ID=<database_id returned by the D1 command>
# EDGE_EVER_R2_BUCKET_NAME=edgeever-resources
# EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD=admin123
# EDGE_EVER_SESSION_TTL_DAYS=400

# Validate the completed configuration before deploying
bun run deploy:doctor
bun run deploy
```

Before running `bun run deploy`, copy the D1 `database_id` and R2 bucket name into your local `.env.local` file. The template uses `admin` / `admin123` for the initial login; edit `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD` if you prefer another initial password. Keep the session lifetime at the template default of `400` days; the server also caps larger values at 400 days.

`bun run deploy` builds the web app, applies remote D1 migrations, deploys the Worker, and uploads `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD` as a Worker Secret. After the first successful login, EdgeEver stores a salted PBKDF2-SHA256 hash in D1. Existing installations may continue to use `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`; when both Secrets are set, the hash takes precedence. Verify the deployment by signing in with `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_USERNAME` and the configured password.

`.env.local` is read only by the local EdgeEver scripts. It is not automatically uploaded to Cloudflare as a file, and it must never be uploaded manually or committed to Git. A build started directly from Cloudflare Dashboard does not automatically receive the D1, R2, or password settings in this file. Use `bun run deploy` for the first deployment, then use `bun run deploy:builds:setup` to copy the required settings securely into Workers Builds.

The deployment command now runs `deploy:doctor` first and stops when the D1 ID, R2 bucket, or login password is missing. Remote D1 migrations are confirmed automatically and require no user input. Before invoking Wrangler, the migration script also verifies that local SQL migrations exist, creates an LF-only copy, and uses a cross-platform absolute migration directory. This prevents both successful-looking Windows commands that migrate no tables and remote D1 misparsing multi-line triggers as `incomplete input`. After deployment, `deploy:verify` checks the remote D1 schema and the Worker's authentication Secret; a missing requirement makes deployment exit as failed. The Worker also fails closed: when a production instance has neither a password Secret nor an enabled user, it returns `auth_not_configured` instead of opening an unauthenticated workspace. `/api/health` checks D1 and authentication initialization; the instance is ready only when it returns `200` with `"ok": true`.

Existing installations do not need to migrate. If you intentionally switch from the hash setting to `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD`, remove the old `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` from `.env.local`, Workers Builds, and the Worker's runtime Secrets; otherwise the legacy hash remains authoritative.

### Recovering login or database initialization failures

- If the login page says the database is not ready, or the API returns `database_not_ready`, verify that the D1 binding is named exactly `DB`, then run `bun run db:migrate:remote && bun run deploy`.
- If the login page says the security setup is incomplete, or the API returns `auth_not_configured`, configure `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`, then run `bun run deploy`. Never clear the account settings to bypass login.
- If credentials were inserted into the `users` table manually, do not put plaintext in `password_hash`. EdgeEver rejects invalid hashes and points to the safe recovery command on the login page. Run:

  ```sh
  EDGE_EVER_PASSWORD='<new password of at least 8 characters>' \
    bun run auth:reset-password -- --remote --username admin
  ```

  This command creates a compatible PBKDF2-SHA256 hash and revokes the account's old sessions without deleting note data.

Cloudflare binding names must be exactly `DB` for D1 and `RESOURCES` for R2. The plain variable `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_USERNAME` does not replace the encrypted `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD` Secret.

## Enable Automatic Updates

After the first deployment, connect the Worker to the fork's `main` branch. Cloudflare Workers Builds is the standard production deployment path for every EdgeEver instance. Follow [Cloudflare Workers Builds](cloudflare-workers-builds.md) to create the configuration-only **User API Token** (not an Account API Token), save it privately as `EDGE_EVER_BUILDS_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local`, then run:

```sh
bun run deploy:builds:setup
```

The command configures the Git repository connection, production trigger, build variables, and the deployment token needed for D1 migrations. Afterwards, use **Sync fork** or push to `main`; Cloudflare automatically builds the web app, applies new remote D1 migrations, and deploys the Worker. No GitHub Actions secrets or local redeployment are required.

Keep `bun run deploy` available for first installation and emergency recovery.
